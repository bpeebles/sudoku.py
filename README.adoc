= Simple code golfing Sudoku solver in Python

A a while ago (about 6 years) I decided to try to code golf a Sudoku solver in Python. This is the
result.

The `sudoku.py` file is partially minimized (short variable names) but with some comments and
saving. While `sudoku_min.py` is minified by hand, for now. Run them by, for example:

----
$ python sudoku.py 123456789456789123789123456000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
123456789456789123789123456214365897365897214897214365531642978642978531978531642

# This one takes quite a while for my solver, almost a minute using a recent PyPy
$ python sudoku.py 850002400720000009004000000000107002305000900040000000000080070017000000000036040
859612437723854169164379528986147352375268914241593786432981675617425893598736241

and it prints the solution it found.
